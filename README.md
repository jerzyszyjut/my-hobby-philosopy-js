# My hobby - philosophy
## HTML website with JavaScript and jQuery
Extended https://github.com/jerzyszyjut/my-hobby-philosopy-html-xml with JS

This is a project I did during my first term of informatics studies on Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology.

It presents a simple website with a few pages and some simple JS features (e.g. dark mode, adding new quotes to quotes list, persisting state using local storage). 

The website is written in HTML, CSS and JS. To meet the requirements I use both Vanilla JavaScript and jQuery (with jQuery plugins)

It was written to show the basics of Vanilla JavaScript and jQuery usage in website.
